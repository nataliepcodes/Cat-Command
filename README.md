# cat command

Create a program called my_cat replicating the cat command.\

The program should read the content of each file that is received as an argument to your software.\
Example:

```
$>ruby my_cat file1 file2
content_file_1
content_file_2
$>
```

# about

The "cat" command is a basic Unix command that concatenates and displays the contents of one or more text files to the terminal.\
The syntax for using the "cat" command is as follows:

```
cat file1 [file2 ... fileN]
```

# open the file

Use the open() function to open the file you want to read. This function returns a file descriptor, which is an integer that represents the opened file.\

```
int file_descriptor = open("filename.txt", O_RDONLY);
```

# create a buffer

You need to create a buffer where the data read from the file will be stored. The read() function reads a specified number of bytes from the file into the buffer.\

```
char buffer[1024];
```

# read the file

Use the read() function to read data from the file. The function takes three arguments: the file descriptor, the buffer where the data will be stored, and the number of bytes to read.\

```
ssize_t bytes_read = read(file_descriptor, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
```

# close the file

Once you've finished reading from the file, you should close it using the close() function. This frees up system resources and ensures that any changes made to the file are saved.\

```
close(file_descriptor);
```

# other

Note that the read() function is a low-level function for reading files, and it may not be the best choice for reading files in all cases. In many situations, you may want to use a higher-level file input/output function such as fgets() or fread() instead.\
This program was created thanks to the information (for opening, creating, reading and closing files) provided by chatGPT!❤️
